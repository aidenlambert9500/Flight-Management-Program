# Flight-Management-Program
ENSF 337 Final Project
Made By: Aiden Lambert, Rohan Lange, Sabrina Li

This is a simple program written entirely in C++ that allows a user to navigate various menus that contain information on a flight.
The program allows the user to:
  - Display the current flight map
  - Display information of current passenegers (i.e. First Name, Last Name, Phone number, row and seat number, and passeneger ID)
  - Add a new passenger to the flight
  - Remove a passenger from the flight
  - Save the modified data to a txt file
It should also be noted that this program has the ability to read and write files with all of this information neatly formatted.
